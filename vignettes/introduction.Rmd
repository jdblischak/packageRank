## packageRank: compute and visualize package download counts and percentiles

### features

* compute the rank percentile and nominal rank of a package's downloads from [RStudio's CRAN mirror](http://cran-logs.rstudio.com).
* visualize a package's position in the  distribution of package download counts for a given day (cross-sectionally) or over time (longitudinally).
* provide S3 plot methods for 'cranlogs' output.

NOTE: 'packageRank' relies on an active internet connection.

### documenation

Possibly due to the use of memoization, a vignette with R code examples does not pass all CRAN tests (Debian platform specifically.) For documenation about 'packageRank', see the README on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=packageRank) or the more current version on [GitHub](https://github.com/lindbrook/packageRank).
